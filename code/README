Blocking Graphics
=================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Renders interactive 3D visualization of 3-dimensional matrix blocking.

USAGE
-----

type at command line: main dir

main: the name of the executable
dir: the folder (absolute) where the input data resides

To quit: press 'esc' key

Example:

main ~/Research/datasets/multi/binary_3d/multi-clustering/multi-clustering_20120901090553/

NOTE:

The program should be run locally. If run while remotely connected to another
machine, the graphics will be very slow due to the graphics card residing
locally and having to get the data remotely.

DESIGN DESCRIPTION
------------------

The program uses block model data: a) parition sizes and b) block densities.
With this information, the program determines how many blocks there are and
computes their centers and their dimensions. The centers are computed relative
to the origin---bottom left front corner. The block densities are used to
determine the block's shade of grey.
